# Training to build a GraphQL API

I did this project to train building a GraphQL API as I have only built RESTful API so far.

## Technical tools

### Front-end

- React : A simple Javascript framework to build a reactive application
- Vite : A fast server to expose my app
- Apollo Client : A front-end library to integrate GraphQL API
- GraphQL Codegen : A plugin to automatically fetch API structure from back-end and facilitate integration

### Back-end

- Javascript
- Vite : A fast server to expose my GraphQL API
- Apollo Server : A back-end library to integrate GraphQL API
- Supabase : A quick to connect remote database
